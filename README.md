furai
=====

*Ps.:* The code is in the **devel** branch.

Furai was my Bachelor Final Project. The goal was to make a cross-platform, high performance, low level, game engine written in C++; with a well planned and documented architecture.

At the time, the plan was to target the Android (with NDK) and the web with NaCL. The project worked! It was pretty fast. In a biased benchmark, much faster than LibGDX :)

But, NaCL died. And the API was based on pre-C++11 code style, and also took a lot of inspirations from Java.
Therefore, I abandoned the project after its presentation.

Unfortunately, part of the code got lost when my HD failed. What you see here is only what I managed to salvage :(
